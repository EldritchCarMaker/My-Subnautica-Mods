# [Adaptive Teleporting Costs](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9795838/AdaptiveTeleportingCosts.zip)

Changes the FCS quantum teleporter to drain power based on distance teleported rather than simply if the teleporter is in the same base or not. Also lets you configure the min and max costs and the scaling rate of cost over distance.
