# Old Mods

These are older versions of my mods, or mods that I don't believe are worth being put on other pages.
If possible, I highly recommend simply using the current versions of the mods, as opposed to any of these outdated ones.

## [Shield Chip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8702937/ShieldChip.zip) (Subnautica)
old version of shield suit from before I turned it into a suit, its just more buggy, less refined, and is a hud chip rather than a suit. 
Please use the shield suit instead, but if you really want a hud chip rather than a suit, here you are. 
I will not be providing updates to this mod as I don't even have the code for it anymore, it was all replaced by the shield suit. 
You're lucky I even have this much here
