# My Below Zero Mods

## [Faster SnowFox Charging](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227669/FasterSnowFoxCharging.zip):


Makes the snowfox docking pad recharge and repair at a configurable rate, also allows the pad to refill percentages of power/health rather than fixed values.

## [Flying SeaTruck](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8694119/FlyingSeaTruck.zip)


adds a module that lets the seatruck fly, has a config for whether the seatruck drops to the ground when not piloted or stays in air

Dependencies: [SmlHelperZero](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/34)

## [Player Tool Changes_BZ](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8309959/PlayerToolChanges_BZ.zip):


Allows you to configure the stats of most tools in game. Must re-equip tool for changes to take effect. Has option for Air bladder changes, currently unused and too lazy to remove. Just pretend the air bladder config doesn't exist.

Dependencies: [SmlHelperZero](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/34)
###### [Changelog](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/PlayerToolChanges_BZ/Changelog.md)


## [SnowFox Quantum Locker](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227678/SnowFoxQuantumLocker.zip):


Adds a storage container to the snowfox. The storage container has a config to choose between three possible options. **ONLY THE STANDARD LOCKER HAS BEEN TESTED**. I believe that the quantum locker also works, however I am not certain to what degree. The snowfox shared locker does not work at all.

The three options are

standard: just a standard locker, hit the key in the config menu to open while riding a snowfox. 4x4 space.

Quantum: gives the snowfox access to the quantum locker network (each snowfox counts as a quantum locker for the purposes of mods such as [Quantum Locker Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/91)). Press the key in the config menu to open the quantum locker network while riding a snowfox.

Snowfox: **DOES NOT WORK, TO BE DONE LATER** Makes a unique locker that is shared between all snowfoxes on the map. Press the key in the config menu to open the snowfox shared locker network. 4x4 space.

# Beta mods

These mods are still in very early testing, some may not work fully, some may not work at all. They are here because I wanted testing for the ones that did work and because I wanted to at least put *something* out there.

If I simply put the file with no extra explanation, it is because I have nothing to say regarding it. It could work fine, and I have no problems, or I might not have tested it and it barely works at all.


[EquivalentExchange.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315479/EquivalentExchange.zip) - also has misc additions such as the hot pink gradient for EMC cost


[EquippableItemIcons.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315483/EquippableItemIcons.zip)


[ArmorSuit.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315485/ArmorSuit.zip) - texture currently somewhat broken, will fix later but functionality and color changing seems to be functional


[BurstFins.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315488/BurstFins.zip) - icon is currently fucked, due to changes with how BZ handles icons and sprites. Believe it still works, just doesn't really show up with the right icon


[MiniatureSuit.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315492/MiniatureSuit.zip)


[SonarChip.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315499/SonarChip.zip)


[SpyWatch.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315500/SpyWatch.zip)


[StasisSuit.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315501/StasisSuit.zip) - also affects cold, didn't even have to add that myself


[TimeControlSuit.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315504/TimeControlSuit.zip)


[WarpChip.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315505/WarpChip.zip)


[MiniatureVehicles.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315493/MiniatureVehicles.zip)


[PickupableVehicles.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315494/PickupableVehicles.zip) - honestly considering not uploading this one, have done zero tests with it yet and I don't think it'll work with the seatruck at all.


[RechargerChips.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315498/RechargerChips.zip)


[CameraDroneUpgrades.zip](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10315506/CameraDroneUpgrades.zip) - includes all below zero versions, the main mod as well as flight, repair, speed, and stasis. Any other drone upgrades mods are likely never going to be ported for various reasons.
