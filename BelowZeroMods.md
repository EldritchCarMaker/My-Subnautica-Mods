## [Player Tool Changes_BZ](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8309959/PlayerToolChanges_BZ.zip):


Allows you to configure the stats of most tools in game. Must re-equip tool for changes to take effect. Has option for Air bladder changes, currently unused and too lazy to remove. Just pretend the air bladder config doesn't exist.

## [SnowFox Quantum Locker](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227678/SnowFoxQuantumLocker.zip):


Adds a storage container to the snowfox. The storage container has a config to choose between three possible options. **ONLY THE STANDARD LOCKER HAS BEEN TESTED**. I believe that the quantum locker also works, however I am not certain to what degree. The snowfox shared locker does not work at all.

The three options are

standard: just a standard locker, hit the key in the config menu to open while riding a snowfox. 4x4 space.

Quantum: gives the snowfox access to the quantum locker network (each snowfox counts as a quantum locker for the purposes of mods such as [Quantum Locker Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/91)). Press the key in the config menu to open the quantum locker network while riding a snowfox.

Snowfox: **DOES NOT WORK, TO BE DONE LATER** Makes a unique locker that is shared between all snowfoxes on the map. Press the key in the config menu to open the snowfox shared locker network. 4x4 space.
