# [Auto Storage Transfer Compatibility](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9795859/AutoStorageTransferCompatibility.zip)


This mod pairs alongside [Auto Storage Transfer](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/AutoStorageTransfer/AutoStoragetransfer.md) and many other mods, including ion cube generator(I'll put a link here later) and even the cyclops reactor mods. Also allows auto storage transfer to work with many extra vanilla items, such as the water filtration unit and the base reactors.
