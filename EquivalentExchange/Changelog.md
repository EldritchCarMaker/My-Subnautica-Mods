**1.2.1:** added auto item converter, a buildable that allows for constant and automatic conversion of emc to exactly one item

**1.2.2:** I don't remember what I changed here 

**1.2.3:** fixed the inability to place reactor rods into the item research station, as well as stopped people from putting fcs kits in there due to infinite-emc exploits
