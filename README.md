 **[BetterCyclopsLockers.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8239047/BetterCyclopsLockers.zip):**

Increases the width and height of the cyclops lockers by a configurable amount (1-15 each on nexus, 1-100 each from this file. I trust github users a bit more, please don't disappoint.) and allows the lockers to function as an autosort target meaning that any placed autosortlocker within the cyclops can automatically deposit to the lockers. 

**Dependencies:** [AutosortLockers](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/31), [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)


**[Drooping Stingers Nerf](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227628/DroopingStingersNerf.zip):**

Decreases the damage drooping stingers do while also fixing the bug that causes them to near instantly kill things.


**[PlayerToolChanges_SN.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227643/PlayerToolChanges_SN.zip)**:

Allows you to configure the stats of most tools in game. Must re-equip tool for changes to take effect.

**Dependencies:** [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

# Subnautica Below Zero Mods

**[FasterSnowFoxCharging.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227669/FasterSnowFoxCharging.zip):**

Makes the snowfox docking pad recharge and repair at a configurable rate, also allows the pad to refill percentages of power/health rather than fixed values.

**Dependencies:** [SmlHelperZero](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/34)


**[PlayerToolChanges_BZ.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227675/PlayerToolChanges_BZ.zip):**

Allows you to configure the stats of most tools in game. Must re-equip tool for changes to take effect. Has option for Air bladder changes, currently unused and too lazy to remove. Just pretend the air bladder config doesn't exist.

**Dependencies:** [SmlHelperZero](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/34)


**[SnowFoxQuantumLocker.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227678/SnowFoxQuantumLocker.zip):**

Adds a storage container to the snowfox. The storage container has a config to choose between three possible options. **ONLY THE STANDARD LOCKER HAS BEEN TESTED**. I believe that the quantum locker also works, however I am not certain to what degree. The snowfox shared locker does not work at all.

The three options are

standard: just a standard locker, hit the key in the config menu to open while riding a snowfox. 4x4 space.

Quantum: gives the snowfox access to the quantum locker network (each snowfox counts as a quantum locker for the purposes of mods such as [Quantum Locker Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/91)). Press the key in the config menu to open the quantum locker network while riding a snowfox.

Snowfox: **DOES NOT WORK, TO BE DONE LATER** Makes a unique locker that is shared between all snowfoxes on the map. Press the key in the config menu to open the snowfox shared locker network. 4x4 space.

Huge thanks to the subnautica modding discord, which is probably where you came from, for helping me with the vast majority if not all of these mods. Wouldn't have them without major help from people there.
