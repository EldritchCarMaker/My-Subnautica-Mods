# Subnautica Mods
 
### [Better Cyclops Lockers](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8239047/BetterCyclopsLockers.zip):


Increases the width and height of the cyclops lockers by a configurable amount (1-15 each on nexus, 1-100 each from this file. I trust github users a bit more, please don't disappoint.) and allows the lockers to function as an autosort target meaning that any placed autosortlocker within the cyclops can automatically deposit to the lockers. 

Dependencies: [AutosortLockers](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/31), [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

### [Remote Control Vehicles](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8592900/RemoteControlVehicles.zip)


Adds three new items to the game; a hud chip, a common vehicle module(usuable for seamoth and prawn), and a cyclops module. Both modules allow you to remotely control the vehicle it's equipped in but you do need the hud chip equipped to use either. Only one remote controlable vehicle is allowed of each type. Only one cyclops can be equipped with the module, and only one prawn/seamoth can be equipped with the module. 

Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113), [More Cyclops Upgrades](https://github.com/PrimeSonic/PrimeSonicSubnauticaMods/releases/tag/Aug5_2021)

### [Equippable Item Icons](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8748398/EquippableItemIcons.zip)


An API for creating new items and icons for said items. Very configurable, ask on discord for information on how to use. Still in progress, but it's basically done apart from adding new things and making sure its bug free.

Any mod that uses this API will have an icon next to the quickslots for each equipped item with a special icon. This icon may or may not drain, depending on the mod it comes from.

### [Warp Chip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8748395/WarpChip.zip)


adds a new equippable chip that warps you forward a slight distance, blueprint unlocks by scanning a warper. Key is configurable, distance is 15m out of base and 10m in base. Cooldown is 5 seconds but is shortened if you don't teleport the full distance.

Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113), Equippable Item Icons

### [Spy Watch](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8748635/SpyWatch.zip)


Adds a new equippable watch(hud chip) that allows you to go invisible for a short amount of time. Creatures shouldn't be able to detect you while invisible, but if something saw you first they may still try to attack. The key is configurable, and after equipping the watch an icon should show up in the bottom right near the quickslots. When using the watch, the icon will slowly drain and this is your indication of how long you have left to be invisible.

### [Burst Fins](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8748400/BurstFins.zip)

Adds a new set of fins as an upgrade to the ultra glide fins. These ones have a short lasting but quick charging battery that can allow for short bursts of incredible speed even while using the seaglide

### [Shield Suit](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8748405/ShieldSuit.zip)

Adds a new suit that allows for the use of a toggleable personal shield. Doesn't last forever, but lasts long enough and recharges pretty quickly. 

Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113), equippable item icons

### [Sonar Chip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8748406/SonarChip.zip)

Adds a new equippable chip that can be activated to let out a sonar burst. Has five charges that slowly regenerate and has a one second delay after use before recharge will begin.

Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113), equippable item icons

### [Cyclops Vehicle Upgrade Console](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8592921/CyclopsVehicleUpgradeConsole.zip)


Improves the vehicle management terminal inside the cyclops (the terminal above the docking bay) to also function as a vehicle upgrade console. Meaning you can change the color and name of your vehicle. More importantly, allows you to fabricate a new seamoth/prawn suit directly inside the cyclops' empty docking bay. Requires the resources be in your inventory, currently doesn't support easy craft's pulling of resources from other containers. Also doesn't currently show resources required, both will be done later hopefully.

### [Pickupable Vehicles](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8694117/PickupableVehicles.zip)

Allows you to pick up vehicles. Has a config for whether it needs a special module to be equipped or if it's just an innate ability. Can change the inventory size of them. Warning: Picking up/dropping the prawn is quite buggy and thus is not allowed by default. You can enable this, but its not recommended for now. Just stick with the seamoth.

### [Seeds From Harvesting](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8599742/SeedsFromHarvesting.zip)


Gives you one seed whenever you harvest a plant like a mushroom or marble melon. Don't need to knife them if you just want to keep the farm sustained. If you want to expand the farm, still need to knife them to get all 4 seeds though. This mod also stops you from planting fully grown plants like the marble melon, now you need to plant the seeds instead. There is a config for this but if you set it to false you can just plant and harvest rapidly to duplicate as many seeds as you want.

### [Sound Commands](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8694124/SoundCommand.zip)


Mostly for mod making, adds three commands to try out sounds. [Link to SN1 sounds](https://github.com/Nagorogan/ECCLibrary/blob/main/Wiki/Resources/SN/FMODEventPathsSN1.txt). Just copy paste one of those after the command PlaySound and it'll play the sound. For loops, use PlayLoopSound and StopLoopSound or else the sound will just go on forever. 

example: PlayLoopSound event:/sub/base/nuke_gen_loop

### [Cyclops Windows](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8672605/CyclopsWindows.zip)


Moves the cyclops lockers to the other side of the wall, replacing them with some super sweet windows. Got a cool button to toggle the windows too

###### [Changelog](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/CyclopsWindows/Changelog.md)


### [Invincible Docked Vehicles](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8693264/InvincibleDockedVehicles.zip)


Makes vehicles invincible when they're docked. More of a bandaid fix for a few bugs in game, but this is the only way I can think of to get them fixed for now at least.

###### No Dependencies

### [Drooping Stingers Nerf](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227628/DroopingStingersNerf.zip):


Decreases the damage drooping stingers do while also fixing the bug that causes them to near instantly kill things.

### [Player Tool Changes_SN](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8309958/PlayerToolChanges_SN.zip):


Allows you to configure the stats of most tools in game. Must re-equip tool for changes to take effect.

Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)
###### [Changelog](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/PlayerToolChanges_SN/Changelog.md)

### [Adaptive Teleporting Costs](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8386445/AdaptiveTeleportingCosts.zip) :


Changes the FCS quantum teleporter to drain power based on distance teleported rather than simply if the teleporter is in the same base or not. Also lets you configure the min and max costs and the scaling rate of cost over distance.

##### Known bugs: teleporting still requires 1500 for out of base and 500 for in base, it just no longer drains this amount

### [Faster SnowFox Charging](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227669/FasterSnowFoxCharging.zip):


Makes the snowfox docking pad recharge and repair at a configurable rate, also allows the pad to refill percentages of power/health rather than fixed values.

### [Flying SeaTruck](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8694119/FlyingSeaTruck.zip)

### [Player Tool Changes_BZ](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8309959/PlayerToolChanges_BZ.zip):


Allows you to configure the stats of most tools in game. Must re-equip tool for changes to take effect. Has option for Air bladder changes, currently unused and too lazy to remove. Just pretend the air bladder config doesn't exist.

### [SnowFox Quantum Locker](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227678/SnowFoxQuantumLocker.zip):


Adds a storage container to the snowfox. The storage container has a config to choose between three possible options. **ONLY THE STANDARD LOCKER HAS BEEN TESTED**. I believe that the quantum locker also works, however I am not certain to what degree. The snowfox shared locker does not work at all.

The three options are

standard: just a standard locker, hit the key in the config menu to open while riding a snowfox. 4x4 space.

Quantum: gives the snowfox access to the quantum locker network (each snowfox counts as a quantum locker for the purposes of mods such as [Quantum Locker Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/91)). Press the key in the config menu to open the quantum locker network while riding a snowfox.

Snowfox: **DOES NOT WORK, TO BE DONE LATER** Makes a unique locker that is shared between all snowfoxes on the map. Press the key in the config menu to open the snowfox shared locker network. 4x4 space.

### old versions 
[ShieldChip.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8702937/ShieldChip.zip) - old version of shield suit from before I turned it into a suit, its just more buggy, less refined, and is a hud chip rather than a suit. Please use the shield suit instead, but if you really want a hud chip rather than a suit, here you are. I will not be providing updates to this mod as I don't even have the code for it anymore, it was all replaced by the shield suit. You're lucky I even have this much here



# Thanks!
Huge thanks to the subnautica modding discord, which is probably where you came from, for helping me with the vast majority if not all of these mods. Wouldn't have them without major help from people there.
