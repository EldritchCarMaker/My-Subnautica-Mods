### [Better Cyclops Lockers](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8884799/BetterCyclopsLockers.zip)


Increases the width and height of the cyclops lockers by a configurable amount (1-15 each on nexus, 1-100 each from this file. I trust github users a bit more, please don't disappoint.) and allows the lockers to function as an autosort target meaning that any placed autosortlocker within the cyclops can automatically deposit to the lockers. 

Dependencies: [AutosortLockers](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/31), [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)
###### [Changelog](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/BetterCyclopsLockers/Changelog.md)


### [Cyclops Torpedoes](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9438326/CyclopsTorpedoes.zip)


Adds a new cyclops module that allows you to shoot torpedoes from the cyclops. Simply place torpedoes into the Cyclops' decoy tube and then enter the cyclops external cameras. From there, just press the torpedo button and, assuming you have the cyclops module equipped, the cyclops will shoot out the torpedo in whatever direction the camera is facing. Should work with modded torpedoes, although I'm not certain if it works with all of them or just some of them.

### [Remote Control Vehicles](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9166554/RemoteControlVehicles.zip)


Adds three new items to the game; a remote control, a common vehicle module(usuable for seamoth and prawn), and a cyclops module. Both modules allow you to remotely control the vehicle it's equipped in but you do need to use the remote control to control them. Only one remote controllable vehicle is allowed of each type. ie; Only one cyclops can be equipped with the module, and only one prawn/seamoth can be equipped with the module.

###### [To Do List](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/RemoteControlVehicles/ToDoList.md)


### [Equippable Item Icons](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8865337/EquippableItemIcons.zip)


An API for creating new items and icons for said items. Very configurable, ask on discord for information on how to use. Still in progress, but it's basically done apart from adding new things and making sure its bug free.

Any mod that uses this API will have an icon next to the quickslots for each equipped item with a special icon. This icon may or may not drain, depending on the mod it comes from.

#### [All-In-One Package](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841583/All-In-One.zip)

This file has every single mod I have made that utilizes Equippable Item Icons. Easier to use this than download each individually if you just want them all. Does not work with vortex/mod managers

Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)
###### [Changelog](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/EquippableItemIcons/Changelog.md)


### [Warp Chip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9166585/WarpChip.zip)


adds a new equippable chip that warps you forward a slight distance, blueprint unlocks by scanning a warper. Key is configurable, distance is 15m out of base and 10m in base(configurable). Cooldown is 5 seconds (configurable) but is shortened if you don't teleport the full distance. Can also hold the warp key for about 5 seconds in order to teleport back to the last base you entered (including cyclops, and config for including lifepod).

Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113), Equippable Item Icons
###### [Changelog](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/WarpChip/Changelog.md)


### [Spy Watch](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841483/SpyWatch.zip)


Adds a new equippable watch(hud chip) that allows you to go invisible for a short amount of time. Creatures shouldn't be able to detect you while invisible, but if something saw you first they may still try to attack. The key is configurable, and after equipping the watch an icon should show up in the bottom right near the quickslots. When using the watch, the icon will slowly drain and this is your indication of how long you have left to be invisible.


Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113), equippable item icons
###### [Changelog](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/SpyWatch/Changelog.md)


### [Burst Fins](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841485/BurstFins.zip)


Adds a new set of fins as an upgrade to the ultra glide fins. These ones have a short lasting but quick charging battery that can allow for short bursts of incredible speed even while using the seaglide

Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113), equippable item icons
###### [Changelog](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/BurstFins/Changelog.md)


### [Shield Suit](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841489/ShieldSuit.zip)

### [Sonar Chip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841490/SonarChip.zip)

### [Camera Drone Upgrades](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9173380/CameraDroneUpgrades.zip)



Another API for improving the camera drones. This mod by default also adds scanning functionality to all drones, without requiring an upgrade to be equipped.
Any mod that uses this API will use an upgrade module that must be inserted into the scanner room upgrades slot in order for the drones to be able to use the upgrades.

#### [All In One Package](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9541082/All-In-One.zip)


This zip file contains every single camera drone mod I have made up until the point of writing this. Just for if you don't feel like downloading each one individually. Does not work with vortex/mod managers

### [Cyclops Vehicle Upgrade Console](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9175085/CyclopsVehicleUpgradeConsole.zip)




Improves the vehicle management terminal inside the cyclops (the terminal above the docking bay) to also function as a vehicle upgrade console. Meaning you can change the color and name of your vehicle. More importantly, allows you to fabricate a new seamoth/prawn suit directly inside the cyclops' empty docking bay. Supports easy craft's pulling of resources from other containers. Also adds in a button on the left of the terminal to allow you to deconstruct any vehicle currently docked in the cyclops, giving your resources back.

### [Pickupable Vehicles](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841545/PickupableVehicles.zip)


Allows you to pick up vehicles. Has a config for whether it needs a special module to be equipped or if it's just an innate ability. Can change the inventory size of them. Warning: Picking up/dropping the prawn is quite buggy and thus is not allowed by default. You can enable this, but its not recommended for now. Just stick with the seamoth.

### [Miniature Vehicles](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9541109/MiniatureVehicles.zip)

### [Seeds From Harvesting](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841548/SeedsFromHarvesting.zip)


Gives you one seed whenever you harvest a plant like a mushroom or marble melon. Don't need to knife them if you just want to keep the farm sustained. If you want to expand the farm, still need to knife them to get all 4 seeds though. This mod also stops you from planting fully grown plants like the marble melon, now you need to plant the seeds instead. There is a config for this but if you set it to false you can just plant and harvest rapidly to duplicate as many seeds as you want.

### [Sound Commands](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841549/SoundCommand.zip)


Mostly for mod making, adds three commands to try out sounds. [Link to SN1 sounds](https://github.com/Nagorogan/ECCLibrary/blob/main/Wiki/Resources/SN/FMODEventPathsSN1.txt). Just copy paste one of those after the command PlaySound and it'll play the sound. For loops, use PlayLoopSound and StopSounds or else the sound will just go on forever. 

example: PlayLoopSound event:/sub/base/nuke_gen_loop

### [Cyclops Windows](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841553/CyclopsWindows.zip)

### [Invincible Docked Vehicles](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841554/InvincibleDockedVehicles.zip)


Makes vehicles invincible when they're docked. More of a bandaid fix for a few bugs in game, but this is the only way I can think of to get them fixed for now at least.

###### No Dependencies

### [Drooping Stingers Nerf](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227628/DroopingStingersNerf.zip):


Decreases the damage drooping stingers do while also fixing the bug that causes them to near instantly kill things.

### [Player Tool Changes_SN](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841555/PlayerToolChanges_SN.zip)


Allows you to configure the stats of most tools in game. Must re-equip tool for changes to take effect.

### [Adaptive Teleporting Costs](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8841556/AdaptiveTeleportingCosts.zip)


Changes the FCS quantum teleporter to drain power based on distance teleported rather than simply if the teleporter is in the same base or not. Also lets you configure the min and max costs and the scaling rate of cost over distance.

##### Known bugs: teleporting still requires 1500 for out of base and 500 for in base, it just no longer drains this amount

### [SnowFox Quantum Locker](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227678/SnowFoxQuantumLocker.zip):


Adds a storage container to the snowfox. The storage container has a config to choose between three possible options. **ONLY THE STANDARD LOCKER HAS BEEN TESTED**. I believe that the quantum locker also works, however I am not certain to what degree. The snowfox shared locker does not work at all.

The three options are

standard: just a standard locker, hit the key in the config menu to open while riding a snowfox. 4x4 space.

Quantum: gives the snowfox access to the quantum locker network (each snowfox counts as a quantum locker for the purposes of mods such as [Quantum Locker Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/91)). Press the key in the config menu to open the quantum locker network while riding a snowfox.

Snowfox: **DOES NOT WORK, TO BE DONE LATER** Makes a unique locker that is shared between all snowfoxes on the map. Press the key in the config menu to open the snowfox shared locker network. 4x4 space.

### old versions 
[ShieldChip.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8702937/ShieldChip.zip) - old version of shield suit from before I turned it into a suit, its just more buggy, less refined, and is a hud chip rather than a suit. Please use the shield suit instead, but if you really want a hud chip rather than a suit, here you are. I will not be providing updates to this mod as I don't even have the code for it anymore, it was all replaced by the shield suit. You're lucky I even have this much here



# Thanks!
Huge thanks to the subnautica modding discord, which is probably where you came from, for helping me with the vast majority if not all of these mods. Wouldn't have them without major help from people there.

Many icons and sprites were made by Tom Stone#0118 and Akari - アカリ#1302 on discord, so thanks to them for the great icons used in my mods!

## Patreon cause someone wanted to donate at one point

https://www.patreon.com/user?u=79717901 I don't even know if they still want to, I just made it so why not link it?
