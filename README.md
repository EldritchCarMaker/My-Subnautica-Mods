### [Better Cyclops Lockers](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8239047/BetterCyclopsLockers.zip):

Increases the width and height of the cyclops lockers by a configurable amount (1-15 each on nexus, 1-100 each from this file. I trust github users a bit more, please don't disappoint.) and allows the lockers to function as an autosort target meaning that any placed autosortlocker within the cyclops can automatically deposit to the lockers. 

Dependencies: [AutosortLockers](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/31), [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

### [Remote Control Vehicles](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8592900/RemoteControlVehicles.zip)


Adds three new items to the game; a hud chip, a common vehicle module(usuable for seamoth and prawn), and a cyclops module. Both modules allow you to remotely control the vehicle it's equipped in but you do need the hud chip equipped to use either. Only one remote controlable vehicle is allowed of each type. Only one cyclops can be equipped with the module, and only one prawn/seamoth can be equipped with the module. 

Dependencies: [SmlHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113), [More Cyclops Upgrades](https://github.com/PrimeSonic/PrimeSonicSubnauticaMods/releases/tag/Aug5_2021)

### [Cyclops Vehicle Upgrade Console](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8592921/CyclopsVehicleUpgradeConsole.zip)


Improves the vehicle management terminal inside the cyclops (the terminal above the docking bay) to also function as a vehicle upgrade console. Meaning you can change the color and name of your vehicle. More importantly, allows you to fabricate a new seamoth/prawn suit directly inside the cyclops' empty docking bay. Requires the resources be in your inventory, currently doesn't support easy craft's pulling of resources from other containers. Also doesn't currently show resources required, both will be done later hopefully.

### [Seeds From Harvesting](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8599742/SeedsFromHarvesting.zip)

Gives you one seed whenever you harvest a plant like a mushroom or marble melon. Don't need to knife them if you just want to keep the farm sustained. If you want to expand the farm, still need to knife them to get all 4 seeds though. This mod also stops you from planting fully grown plants like the marble melon, now you need to plant the seeds instead. There is a config for this but if you set it to false you can just plant and harvest rapidly to duplicate as many seeds as you want.

### [Drooping Stingers Nerf](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227628/DroopingStingersNerf.zip):

Decreases the damage drooping stingers do while also fixing the bug that causes them to near instantly kill things.

### [Player Tool Changes_SN](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8309958/PlayerToolChanges_SN.zip):

Allows you to configure the stats of most tools in game. Must re-equip tool for changes to take effect.

### [Adaptive Teleporting Costs](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8386445/AdaptiveTeleportingCosts.zip) :

Changes the FCS quantum teleporter to drain power based on distance teleported rather than simply if the teleporter is in the same base or not. Also lets you configure the min and max costs and the scaling rate of cost over distance.

##### Known bugs: teleporting still requires 1500 for out of base and 500 for in base, it just no longer drains this amount

### [FasterSnowFoxCharging.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227669/FasterSnowFoxCharging.zip):

### [PlayerToolChanges_BZ.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8309959/PlayerToolChanges_BZ.zip):

Allows you to configure the stats of most tools in game. Must re-equip tool for changes to take effect. Has option for Air bladder changes, currently unused and too lazy to remove. Just pretend the air bladder config doesn't exist.

### [SnowFoxQuantumLocker.zip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8227678/SnowFoxQuantumLocker.zip):

Adds a storage container to the snowfox. The storage container has a config to choose between three possible options. **ONLY THE STANDARD LOCKER HAS BEEN TESTED**. I believe that the quantum locker also works, however I am not certain to what degree. The snowfox shared locker does not work at all.

The three options are

standard: just a standard locker, hit the key in the config menu to open while riding a snowfox. 4x4 space.

Quantum: gives the snowfox access to the quantum locker network (each snowfox counts as a quantum locker for the purposes of mods such as [Quantum Locker Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/91)). Press the key in the config menu to open the quantum locker network while riding a snowfox.

Snowfox: **DOES NOT WORK, TO BE DONE LATER** Makes a unique locker that is shared between all snowfoxes on the map. Press the key in the config menu to open the snowfox shared locker network. 4x4 space.

Huge thanks to the subnautica modding discord, which is probably where you came from, for helping me with the vast majority if not all of these mods. Wouldn't have them without major help from people there.
