## [Old mods](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/OldMods.md)
Older versions of mods, or mods that I don't feel are worth putting up.

## Thanks!
Huge thanks to the subnautica modding discord, which is probably where you came from, for helping me with the vast majority if not all of these mods. Wouldn't have them without major help from people there.

Many icons and sprites were made by Tom Stone#0118 and Akari - アカリ#1302 on discord, so thanks to them for the great icons used in my mods!

## Patreon cause someone wanted to donate at one point

https://www.patreon.com/user?u=79717901 I don't even know if they still want to, I just made it so why not link it?

## Permissions and stuffs
For convenience and consistency, I am now going to be directing people towards the nexus permissions on the given mod. This is especially true as some of the mods contain assets which I have been given permission to use but do not have the permission to transfer permission to others
