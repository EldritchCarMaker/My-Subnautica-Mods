## [Old mods](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/blob/main/OldMods.md)
Older versions of mods, or mods that I don't feel are worth putting up.

## Thanks!
Huge thanks to the subnautica modding discord, which is probably where you came from, for helping me with the vast majority if not all of these mods. Wouldn't have them without major help from people there.

Many icons and sprites were made by Tom Stone#0118 and Akari - アカリ#1302 on discord, so thanks to them for the great icons used in my mods!

## Patreon cause someone wanted to donate at one point

https://www.patreon.com/user?u=79717901 I don't even know if they still want to, I just made it so why not link it?

## Permissions and stuffs
I give permission to anyone and everyone to modify and or distribute my mods and the files contained within, under the following restrictions. 

I only ask that 

1; do not upload my files to nexus mods, even if modified. 

2; please give credit to me as the original author if possible. 

3; if I ask for you to remove one of my mods that you have put up somewhere, please do so.

In addition, I simply ask that if you upload one of my mods somewhere, let me know. You can do this by messaging me on discord (EldritchCarMaker#8108), or letting me know through github. Discord is preferable.
