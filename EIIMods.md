# Equippable Item Icons Mods

## [Equippable Item Icons](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10304452/EquippableItemIcons.zip)


An API for creating new items and icons for said items. Very configurable, ask on discord for information on how to use. Still in progress, but it's basically done apart from adding new things and making sure its bug free.

Any mod that uses this API will have an icon next to the quickslots for each equipped item with a special icon. This icon may or may not drain, depending on the mod it comes from.

#### [All-In-One Package](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689290/All-In-One.zip)

This file has every single mod I have made that utilizes Equippable Item Icons. Easier to use this than download each individually if you just want them all. Does not work with vortex/mod managers

## [Armor Suit](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10304456/ArmorSuit.zip)


It's a suit that provides damage reduction. Wow, shocking. The twist is that it can only provide damage reduction to a single damage type at a time. So you're burning to death? Well the suit can offer you 90% heat resistance, but if you get bit by something you're taking that full damage. Or maybe you want to roll around taking 2-3 damage per bite, and laugh at everything brushing off you. Well if you get hit by something hot, or perhaps poisoned then you're now taking that full damage instead. This icon is by far the fanciest I've ever worked with. Hint; keep an eye on the icon on your hotbar when it switches damage types Speaking of switchin damage types, guess what you can do? Yea, switch damage types, how'd you know? There's two configs for the mod, one is the keybind, press this key and the suit will rotate to the next damage type in the sequence, and a config for whether or not the suit will auto adapt. auto adapting means that the suit will automatically change it's own damage type to react to whatever damage you're taking. Now, here's the downside, it only reacts after you have taken the damage. So if you're about to be bit, gotta switch to physical defense manually or you're gonna take that damage. Now, the second bite is gonna be a lot easier on you, cause the suit will automatically react to the bite and swap to the physical defense, but you're all on your own for that first bite. If you want to make full use of the suit, you need to be swapping the defense types manually, or you can just rely on the suit's auto adaptive capabilities to let yourself be lazy, at the expense of some health.

## [Spy Watch](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689293/SpyWatch.zip)


Adds a new equippable watch(hud chip) that allows you to go invisible for a short amount of time. Creatures shouldn't be able to detect you while invisible, but if something saw you first they may still try to attack. The key is configurable, and after equipping the watch an icon should show up in the bottom right near the quickslots. When using the watch, the icon will slowly drain and this is your indication of how long you have left to be invisible.

## [Stasis Suit](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689300/StasisSuit.zip)


This suit uses Stasis rifle technology to temporarily freeze internal organs in time, halting natural resource consumption. Meaning this suit can, temporarily, stop all need for food, water, oxygen, and even stop you from getting hurt!

## [Time Control Suit](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689301/TimeControlSuit.zip)


This suit uses Stasis rifle technology but brings it to the max. For a very short amount of time, with a fairly long cooldown, can completely *stop time itself* all around you, while still allowing you to remain free. It's unknown exactly who made this suit, all you know is it randomly appeared in your blueprints once finding an ion cube and you can't possibly pass it up.
