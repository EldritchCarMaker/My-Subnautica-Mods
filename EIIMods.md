# Equippable Item Icons Mods

## [Equippable Item Icons](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/8865337/EquippableItemIcons.zip)


An API for creating new items and icons for said items. Very configurable, ask on discord for information on how to use. Still in progress, but it's basically done apart from adding new things and making sure its bug free.

Any mod that uses this API will have an icon next to the quickslots for each equipped item with a special icon. This icon may or may not drain, depending on the mod it comes from.

#### [All-In-One Package](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689290/All-In-One.zip)

This file has every single mod I have made that utilizes Equippable Item Icons. Easier to use this than download each individually if you just want them all. Does not work with vortex/mod managers

## [Warp Chip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689291/WarpChip.zip)


adds a new equippable chip that warps you forward a slight distance, blueprint unlocks by scanning a warper. Key is configurable, distance is 15m out of base and 10m in base(configurable). Cooldown is 5 seconds (configurable) but is shortened if you don't teleport the full distance. Can also hold the warp key for about 5 seconds in order to teleport back to the last base you entered (including cyclops, and config for including lifepod).

## [Spy Watch](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689293/SpyWatch.zip)


Adds a new equippable watch(hud chip) that allows you to go invisible for a short amount of time. Creatures shouldn't be able to detect you while invisible, but if something saw you first they may still try to attack. The key is configurable, and after equipping the watch an icon should show up in the bottom right near the quickslots. When using the watch, the icon will slowly drain and this is your indication of how long you have left to be invisible.

## [Burst Fins](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689294/BurstFins.zip)


Adds a new set of fins as an upgrade to the ultra glide fins. These ones have a short lasting but quick charging battery that can allow for short bursts of incredible speed even while using the seaglide

## [Stasis Suit](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689300/StasisSuit.zip)


This suit uses Stasis rifle technology to temporarily freeze internal organs in time, halting natural resource consumption. Meaning this suit can, temporarily, stop all need for food, water, oxygen, and even stop you from getting hurt!

## [Time Control Suit](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689301/TimeControlSuit.zip)


This suit uses Stasis rifle technology but brings it to the max. For a very short amount of time, with a fairly long cooldown, can completely *stop time itself* all around you, while still allowing you to remain free. It's unknown exactly who made this suit, all you know is it randomly appeared in your blueprints once finding an ion cube and you can't possibly pass it up.

## [Sonar Chip](https://github.com/Nagorogan/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/9689297/SonarChip.zip)


Adds a new equippable chip that can be activated to let out a sonar burst. Has five charges that slowly regenerate and has a one second delay after use before recharge will begin.
