## [Cyclops Vehicle Upgrade Console](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/files/10388084/CyclopsVehicleUpgradeConsole.zip)

Improves the vehicle management terminal inside the cyclops (the terminal above the docking bay) to also function as a vehicle upgrade console. Meaning you can change the color and name of your vehicle. More importantly, allows you to fabricate a new seamoth/prawn suit directly inside the cyclops' empty docking bay. Supports easy craft's pulling of resources from other containers. Also adds in a button on the left of the terminal to allow you to deconstruct any vehicle currently docked in the cyclops, giving your resources back.
